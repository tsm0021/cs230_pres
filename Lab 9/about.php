        About the Site Creator
        <p>
            My name is Trey McAtee. I am completely new to HTML, so I apoligize outright for possible spaghetti code.
            Outside of that, I will most likely choose to make
            this site into a review site and hope to learn alot from this course. Also, in my visual studio, which I am
            also completely new too, the h1 and a few other elements for this code is
            highlighted red. It still seems to work though, so at least for the scope of this lab I guessed it wouldn't
            be an issue. Also, my button doesn't do anything,
            but I guessed that too wouldn't be an issue as the requirement was just to have one.
